# Compressive sensing for fiber optics

This repository contains the Python code for my master's thesis 'Compressive sensing for multimode fiber optical imaging' (attached as a pdf). It is structured according to the thesis' chapters, and contains besides the Python scripts the .npz files with the simulation results used to create Figures ... , which can be found in the subfolders 'data'.
